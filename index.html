<p align="justify"> Monalisa’s father owns a small shop in the village of Sarisha (near Diamond Harbour) in South 24 Parganas, where she grew up. Since her father’s income is not enough to support the family her mother has to work as a daily labourer in a local pen factory. Monalisa’s merit became evident when she won a scholarship in her primary school for securing the eighth position in her district. She went on to score 92.4% in Madhyamik and then stood eighth in the state in the H.S Examinations in 2016, with 97%. She is currently pursuing her bachelor’s in English from Rabindra Bharati University. Srijan Sujan wishes to help her realise her dream of becoming a WBCS officer. </p>
